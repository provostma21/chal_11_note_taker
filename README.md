# <Note-Taker>

## Description

I wanted to build an easy-to-use application that allowed be to quickly add notes to my list. In particular, I wanted it to be able to to easily list out my 
tasks for the day in a clear and visual manner. And then I can delete tasks as I complete them throughout the day. This resulted in keeping me more organized and on track thoughout the day. This allowed me to get a good basic understanding of databases and persistent data.

## Usage

Click on the "Get Started" button as shown below.
